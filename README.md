## üó∫Ô∏è My Learning Path & Advice
This section reflects my approach to learning competitive programming across various platforms. It might serve as a guide for others!

### General Progression Tips:
- **Build Foundations:** Start with 'Easy' problems on LeetCode or 'Rating 800-1000' on Codeforces. Focus on basic data structures, implementation, and I/O.
- **Master Core Algorithms:** Once comfortable, move to 'Medium' problems and higher ratings. Deep dive into Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS), Binary Search, Two Pointers, Greedy algorithms. Use the 'Problems by Concept/Tag' section to practice specific topics.
- **Platform Nuances:** Be aware that each platform might have slightly different problem styles. LeetCode is great for interview prep, Codeforces for contest problem-solving, Beecrowd for pure logic/math.
- **Consistent Practice:** Solve problems daily or weekly. Participate in contests to test your skills under pressure.
- **Learn from Others:** Don't hesitate to look at solutions (after trying extensively!) to understand different approaches and optimizations.

## ü§ù Contributions & Feedback
While this is primarily a personal repository, I welcome feedback and suggestions!
- **Spot an optimization or a bug?** Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Angkon-Kar/Competitive-Programming-Journey/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Angkon-Kar/Competitive-Programming-Journey/pulls).
- **Have questions about a solution?** Don't hesitate to ask by opening an issue.
- **Want to use my solutions?** You're welcome to learn from them! Please attribute if you share them publicly.
