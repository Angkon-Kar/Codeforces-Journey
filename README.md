## üó∫Ô∏è My Learning Path & Advice
This section reflects my journey and how I approach learning competitive programming. It might serve as a guide for others!

### Suggested Learning Progression:
- **Start with Basics (Rating 800-1000):** Focus on implementation, basic math, and simple data structures. Get comfortable with problem reading and input/output.
- **Dive into Core Algorithms (Rating 1000-1400):** Explore Dynamic Programming (DP), Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS), Binary Search, Two Pointers, and Greedy algorithms. Practice problems specifically tagged with these concepts.
- **Advanced Topics (Rating 1400+):** Branch out into more complex data structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees), advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall), number theory, combinatorics, and flow algorithms. Pay attention to time and space complexity.
- **Consistency is Key:** Solve problems regularly, participate in contests, and always review solutions (even if you solve them) to learn new tricks.

## ü§ù Contributions & Feedback
While this is primarily a personal repository, I welcome feedback and suggestions!
