# My Competitive Programming Journey üöÄ
Welcome to my comprehensive collection of solutions from various online judges! This repository showcases problems solved on platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, Beecrowd, HackerRank, and HackerEarth, organized by platform, rating/difficulty, and algorithmic concept.

## üìä Journey Statistics
![Total Problems Solved](https://img.shields.io/badge/Total_Problems-0-blue)

### Problem Distribution:
- **800:** 0 problems
- **900:** 0 problems

## üîç How to Explore
You can easily navigate through the problems:
- **By Platform & Category:** Browse the sections below for problems grouped by their original platform and then by their rating (for Codeforces) or difficulty (for others).
- **By Concept/Tag:** Find problems categorized by the algorithms or data structures they use.
- **GitHub Search:** Use GitHub's search bar (at the top of the repository page) to quickly find specific problem names or keywords within my solutions.

## üåê Problems by Platform & Category

## üó∫Ô∏è My Learning Path & Advice
This section reflects my approach to learning competitive programming across various platforms. It might serve as a guide for others!

### General Progression Tips:
- **Build Foundations:** Start with 'Easy' problems on LeetCode or 'Rating 800-1000' on Codeforces. Focus on basic data structures, implementation, and I/O.
- **Master Core Algorithms:** Once comfortable, move to 'Medium' problems and higher ratings. Deep dive into Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS), Binary Search, Two Pointers, Greedy algorithms. Use the 'Problems by Concept/Tag' section to practice specific topics.
- **Platform Nuances:** Be aware that each platform might have slightly different problem styles. LeetCode is great for interview prep, Codeforces for contest problem-solving, Beecrowd for pure logic/math.
- **Consistent Practice:** Solve problems daily or weekly. Participate in contests to test your skills under pressure.
- **Learn from Others:** Don't hesitate to look at solutions (after trying extensively!) to understand different approaches and optimizations.

## ü§ù Contributions & Feedback
